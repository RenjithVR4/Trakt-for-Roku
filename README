Trakt Appication for Roku Streaming Players

The first version of this application will serve as a hub for Trakt.tv users, allowing access to their Calendar, Recommendations, T.V. and Movie watchlists, and tending shows and movies.  Initially the app will simple serve as a Trakt.tv browser designed for the Roku.  As Roku, Inc. adds functionality, this app may be used to scrobble watched media on the Roku in the background and update Trakt accordingly.
